## Why Firebase Admin SDK Doesn't Handle User Sign-In:

1. Role of Firebase Admin SDK: The Firebase Admin SDK is designed for administrative tasks such as creating, managing, and verifying users. It’s meant to be used in privileged environments like backend servers or cloud functions, where the server has access to the entire user database and can perform sensitive tasks (like creating and deleting users, or managing custom claims).

    Key tasks of Firebase Admin SDK:

    - Creating users (createUser)
    - Verifying ID tokens (verifyIdToken)
    - Custom authentication flows (e.g., assigning custom claims, generating custom tokens)

    What it doesn't do: The Admin SDK doesn’t handle direct user sign-ins because sign-in involves handling credentials (passwords, etc.), which should generally occur in a secure, user-facing client like a browser or mobile app. The backend should verify tokens, not handle user passwords directly.

2. User Authentication Flow: Firebase Authentication on the client side (browser, mobile, etc.) is intended to handle user sign-ins securely, where credentials like passwords are submitted and verified by Firebase servers. After sign-in, Firebase provides an ID token or access token to the client. This token is then passed to your backend server to authenticate further requests.

    Key reason: Sign-in involves user credentials (email/password, etc.), which need to be securely transmitted and processed by Firebase Authentication services, not by your backend directly. You don’t want your backend to handle raw user passwords or credentials, as it increases security risks.

## Why Authenticate from the Client (Frontend):
1. Security: The primary reason for handling user authentication from the frontend is security. By keeping authentication client-side:

    - Passwords and sensitive information are sent directly to Firebase over secure channels (using the Firebase Authentication service) without being exposed to your backend.
    -The backend only deals with ID tokens (which prove the user has already been authenticated), minimizing the risk of handling raw passwords.
2. Decoupling Authentication from Your Backend: Firebase Authentication is designed to offload the complexity of sign-in to Firebase servers. Your backend only needs to verify tokens (via Firebase Admin SDK) and doesn’t have to manage login logic or handle user credentials directly.

### How Authentication Normally Works:
1. Frontend Authentication:
    - The client (browser/mobile app) uses the Firebase Authentication Client SDK to sign in the user (e.g., using email/password).
    - Firebase returns an ID token.
2. Token Handling:
    - The client passes this ID token with each request to the backend (e.g., in the `Authorization` header).
3. Backend Verification:
    - Your backend (using Firebase Admin SDK) verifies the ID token with `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token)` to confirm that the token is valid and the user is authenticated.
### But Why Can't We Use Firebase Admin for Sign-In?

The Admin SDK doesn’t expose methods like `signInWithEmailAndPassword` because these methods are not designed for use in privileged environments like a backend server. Firebase designed the flow this way to:

- Separate concerns: Client-side handles sign-in (credentials), backend handles token verification.
- Improve security: Passwords and sensitive authentication logic stay client-side, and your backend only handles tokens (which are less risky than handling passwords directly).
